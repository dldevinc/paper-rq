## `job` decorator

The same as RQ's job decorator, but it automatically works out
the `connection` argument from RQ_QUEUES.

If `RQ.DEFAULT_RESULT_TTL` setting is set, it is used as default
for `result_ttl` kwarg.

If `RQ.DEFAULT_FAILURE_TTL` setting is set, it is used as default
for `failure_ttl` kwarg.

Example:
```python
import time

from paper_rq.decorators import job


@job("paper:default")
def sleep(delay):
    time.sleep(delay)
```

```python
sleep.delay(5)
```

## RQ Scheduler

First you need to make sure you have the `rq-scheduler` library installed:

```shell
pip install rq-scheduler
```

If you need to run multiple isolated schedulers, you can use the class
`paper_rq.scheduler.Scheduler`. It reads the Redis keys from the `RQ` setting:

```python
# settings.py

RQ = {
    "DEFAULT_RESULT_TTL": "7d",
    "DEFAULT_FAILURE_TTL": "30d",
    "SCHEDULER_CLASS": "paper_rq.scheduler.Scheduler",
    "SCHEDULER_LOCK_KEY": "rq:scheduler-1:scheduler_lock",
    "SCHEDULER_JOBS_KEY": "rq:scheduler-1:scheduled_jobs",
}
```
